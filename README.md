# Convolutional-Autoencoder
A fully implemented Convolutional Autoencoder in Numpy

# Requirements
- numpy
- numba
- matplotlib
- pytorch

Convolutional Autoencoder fully implemented in numpy and optimized to run fastr on cpu using numba.jit . The Autoencoder is implemented same as the one in pytorch so one can use the model 
as one likes . The number of layers can be adjusted along with channels,kernels,stride etc same as pytorch/tensorflow giving leverage to adjust the model according to needs.
